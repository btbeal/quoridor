# Quoridor RL


### Project Deets

This project is a passion project to both develop the game Quoridor and subsequently employ reinforcement learning (Deep Q Learning)
to teach an agent to play. 

To try for yourself, the current state requires the modification of `main.py` to the players required: (AIPlayer or Player). The AIPlayer
currently has no saved model to leverage, which is to come.
